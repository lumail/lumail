lumail (0.25) stable; urgency=low

  * New release, fixing several bugs.
  * References here are to the Github repository issue tracker:
    https://github.com/skx/lumail/issues
    #172 - Allow external input via a Unix domain socket, this must be
           enabled explicitly:
           http://lumail.org/lua/bind_socket.html
         - Added new `lumailctl` binary to send input to the socket.
    #175 - Displaying message post-compose.
           This lead to the introduction of a new mode for displaying
           text, and scrolling around in it.  As used by help().
    #177 - More flexible TAB completion for file/directories.
           This takes into account the current working directory.
    #180 - Updated options parser to avoid segfault on missing argument
           to --debug/-d.

  * BUGFIX: Avoid crashing when TAB-completing an empty token.
  * BUGFIX: TAB-completion always expands tildes.
  * CHANGE: help() shows the manual, if invoked with no argument.
  * CHANGE: Default keybindings for "up", "down", and "search" ("/"),
    have been simplified via routines: up(), down() and search_next().
  * New primitive: show_file_contents() to show the contents of a file:
    http://lumail.org/lua/show_file_contents.html
  * New primitive: show_text(), to display an arbitrary array of text
    from lua: http://lumail.org/lua/show_text.html
  * New primitive: cd() + cwd(), for working with the current directory.
    http://lumail.org/lua/cd.html
    http://lumail.org/lua/cwd.html
  * BREAKING CHANGE: scroll_message_to renamed to be jump_message_to.
    scroll_message_to has been repurposed, as the function to search the
    current message for the next regular expression match.

     - #110 - Allow search_next() to reuse prior input.
     - #107 - Some messages are displayed with corruption
     - #106 - mark_new() is buggy.  This was fixed and the function
              renamed to be "mark_unread" for consistency.
     - #104 - Moved code out of main.cc for simplicity.
     - #103 - history_file() allows input-history to persist:
              http://lumail.org/lua/history_file.html
     - #101 - Moved to using GMime for all MIME work.

lumail (0.17) stable; urgency=low

  * New release, fixing several bugs.
  * References here are to the Github repository issue tracker:
    https://github.com/skx/lumail/issues
     - #66 - Removed inadequate header-field decoding, because it just
             didn't work.  This is our biggest outstanding issue.
     - #93 - Two new primitives: is_maildir & create_maildir.
             The `sent_folder` setting is unset by default.
     - #94 - Fixed a leak in the lua stack.
     - #95 - Segfaults due to on_message_parse().
     - #96 - Segfaults due to on_message_parse().
     - #98 - Don't segfault if an empty configuration file is read.
     - #99 - Setup a stub keymap if nothing is defined.
             This just maps: q/Q/x/X to exit.
   * The msg() primitive can now output boolean values in addition
     to strings and numbers.  Other types will display an error.
     (e.g. "function" or "table" are unsupported, but "nil" works.)
   * New global variable "ignore_case" to disable case insensitive
     TAB-completion.
   * TAB-completion ambiguities can be navigated via "left" + "right"
     arrows in addition to TAB.
   * Installation of a lua "panic" handler.  To be called in extremis.
   * Additional logging for lumail-debug.
   * Allow compilation to succeed on older g++ versions, by reordering args.
   * Simplified handling for the --folder command line flag.
      http://lumail.org/cmdline/
   * Only call on_read_message() once, regardless of how many times a message
     is displayed/re-displayed.
   * New filter "msg_filter" which replaces on_message_parse() - which caused
     segfaults for complex reasons.  (i.e. We couldn't track it down!)
